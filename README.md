This project predicts housing prices in Bangalore using a machine learning model trained with Linear Regression. The project features an interactive user interface that allows users to input details such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and balconies, as well as the area (selected from a dropdown menu) and square footage. Based on this information, users can click the "Estimate Price" button to see an estimated price for their desired property.


### Features
  - **Interactive UI:** Users can easily input property details, select locality, and get price estimates with a single click.
  - **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes Linear Regression to deliver real-time price predictions based on user inputs.
  - **Customization:** The UI is designed for intuitive input and immediate feedback on estimated property prices.


### Technical Requirements
  - **Programming Language:** Python
  - **Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (for data processing and model training)
  - **Framework:** Flask (for backend server), HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for frontend)

### Usage
1. Clone the Repository
2. Install Dependencies Ensure you have Python installed, then use the following command to install the required libraries:
3. Run the Backend Server Start the Flask backend server to handle prediction requests:This should start the server at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
4. Open the User Interface Open index.html in your preferred browser to access the UI. Alternatively, you may serve the file using a local server (e.g., using Python's built-in HTTP server).
5. Enter Property Details
      - Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Balconies: Select the number of rooms.
      - Locality: Choose an area from the dropdown menu.
