This project predicts housing prices in Bangalore using a machine learning model trained with Linear Regression. The project features an interactive user interface that allows users to input details such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and balconies, as well as the area (selected from a dropdown menu) and square footage. Based on this information, users can click the "Estimate Price" button to see an estimated price for their desired property.

  - **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes Linear Regression to deliver real-time price predictions based on user inputs.
  - **Customization:** The UI is designed for intuitive input and immediate feedback on estimated property prices.


### Technical Requirements
  - **Programming Language:** Python
  - **Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (for data processing and model training)
  - **Framework:** Flask (for backend server), HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for frontend)
